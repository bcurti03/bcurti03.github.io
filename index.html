						<h1>Work Term 1</h1>
						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>1.</h2>
								<h3>Seek information pertaining to given problems and identify the causes, both independently & timely</h3>
								<p>By the end of the term I was able to quickly identify and fix issues, partly due to dealing with the similar 
									issues earier in the term, such as troubleshooting a office wide adobe acrobat crashing issue.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>2.</h2>
								<h3>Independentally devise and research fixes to software and hardware issues</h3>
								<p>It came to the point where I was able to fix multiple issues within an hour or 
									two without needing to consult my supervisor. For example I fixed two employee's 
									problems involving a version of Microsoft Teams than became hung on startup.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>3.</h2>
								<h3>Understand the numerous processes and solutions that assist in performing my day-to-day activities</h3>
								<p>An example that reflects how I came to reach this goal, was when I was tasked with mentoring another employee with the technical process involved in cloning and creating 
									a split disk format of a VM. Thanks to my understanding of the process, I was able to succesfully teach another employee a technical skill important 
									to a project.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>4.</h2>
								<h3>Adhear to the stated due dates on office tasks, and complete tasks without set dates in order of importance</h3>
								<p>Tasks were generally completed prior or on their due dates but the realities of the postition resulted in certain 
									lower priority tasks being delayed to focus on higher priority tasks. As an example, the rollout of regular employee's 
									new devices had to be suspended due to an unforseen hardware issue with a desktop used by upper management.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>5.</h2>
								<h3>Convey my points in a clear and concise manner, for a diverse range of readers</h3>
								<p>Two sentences was eventually the amount I was able to hone the large majority of my explanations 
									to and this was the same between both technical and non-technical employees. This helped me to move
									quickly through troubleshooting problems without much holdup on communication issues.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<p>The skills I learned in my journey towards these goals will certainly be an asset in any future IT positions I apply for because of the fact that
							the technical skills I learned are applicable across a wide variety of industries (Hardware rollout, Office 365 suite, etc.), and the majority 
							of my troubleshooting was done on Windows based devices, one of the most wided used OS's in the business world.</p>

							<h2>During my first work term at Eramosa Engineering I provided in-office IT support for employees.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My day-to-day tasks involved cloning and modifying the format of Virtual Machines, troubleshooting everyday software and hardware issues, 
							rolling out new laptops and replacement laptops, as well as work phones, writing documentation for in-house use, and managing user permission's through Azure AD, 
							Intune, and Windows Server. Most of these tasks required a certain depth of understanding with the Windows OS and it's system applications, 
							in tandem with system applications by manufacturers (mainly Dell, Lenovo and HP). The majority of these tasks were completed using experience I gained on the job.</p>
					</section>
				
				<!-- three -->
					<section id="wt1-three">
						<header class="major">
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						</header>
						<p>From my time at Eramosa, I had acheived my stated goals, and learned a number of key skills that I had not excpected at the beginning of the term.
							From the familiarity I gained with important communication and management tools like Microsoft Teams and Azure, to more development and IT focused tools like 
							VMware Workstation, G4L, and Disk2VHD, my set of skills has increased markedly since the beginning of my work term. Finally my contributions to the office wide
							hardware transition from Lenovo laptops to HP's has left me content that I left Eramosa having contributed something of worth to the day to day office life.</p>

					<section id="wt2-one">
						<h1>Work Term 2</h1>
						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>1.</h2>
								<h3>Gain experience using remote access software and other remote work tools, to maintain a level of connectivity with other employees while they work from home</h3>
								<p>Given the fact that I compiled and edited documents regarding performing user and administrator rollout steps on Android and iPhone devices and removing Apple devices
									from the Intune enrollment tokens and the Apple MDM portal, I beleive my goal has been acheived in this case. I also provided training regarding several technical 
									procedures to the new co-op student that was tasked with onboarding during the last week of my work term. 
</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>2.</h2>
								<h3>Manage my schedule efficiently while being the only IT employee in the office and make efficient use of my time and other employees time</h3>
								<p>I beleive that for the most part I was able to meet this goal (excuding circumstances where I was required to wait due to the availability of other user's). 
									This was demonstrated in instances like the day I rolled-out four user's phones to them, backed up their data from their old phones and restored it to 
									the new ones in the same day and still had time to work on my daily tasks like troubleshooting software issues and creating/cloning VMs.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>3.</h2>
								<h3>Coordinate work according to access to resources and cooperate on problems that require multiple people to contribute from varying locations</h3>
								<p>I was able to acheive this goal by the end of my work term as I was aware which steps of tasks such as performing laptop and phone rollouts were 
									possible to perform individually and which steps required me to coordinate with other IT team members. As an example when performing a laptop 
									rollout by the end of the semester the G4L imaging, software updates and installs and hardware/accesories gathering steps were all performed 
									on my end but only after Nandan had created the user's Microsoft user profile.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>4.</h2>
								<h3>Maintain a clear channel of communication as coordinating with users and team members over Microsoft Teams has become frequent since the lockdown</h3>
								<p>I was able to meet this objective both with interactions in office and out of office. For example there were several times I needed to show another IT 
									team member the server room and run system diagnostics steps on the dell servers based on his instructions as well as convey the results of the 
									test via Microsoft Teams video call.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>5.</h2>
								<h3>Efficiently resolve user's hardware and software issues and ensure that the solution is long-lasting</h3>
								<p>For the most part I was able to succeed in acheiving this goal in my time troubleshooting hardware and software issues this work term. For instance, 
									there were commonly occuring VPN issues that I was able to tailor a pool of fixes to supply to users facing the issue (usualy fixed via enabling 
									TCP/IP services, running netsh winsock reset in command line or by changing their login password via sharepoint, depending on the error pop-up)</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<p>My expanded skill set from this work term (mentoring a new IT Hire regarding the day-today activities and processes, and managing mass iPhone and android rollouts)
							Should not only allow me to apply myself further in the IT sphere of employment but also provide me with applicable experience with mentoring new employees
							in a variety of industries by applying the same principles I used in the  mentoring this term.</p>

							<h2>During my second work term at Eramosa Engineering I provided remote IT support for employees working from home and administered the office wide mobile device upgrades.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Many of my daily activities carried over from the first work term (cloning VMs, software/hardware troubleshooting, writing documentation, etc.) but this work term I was also 
							supplied with new responsibilities like rolling out the new phones for every employee in the company over the length of the work term and training the new co-op student 
							that was picking up where my work left off. These new tasks required me to develop new skills working with tools like Apple Configurator 2, and Samsung Knox Deployment 
							portal. Most of my daily activities were completed using experience I gained on the job last work term and during this work term.</p>
					</section>
				
				<!-- Three -->
					<section id="wt2-three">
						<header class="major">
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						</header>
						<p>By the end of my second work term at Eramosa, my goals were met, and I had developed a new collection of skills that were distinct from what I learning in my first work term.
							Performing remote assistance for users was a bit of a hurdle to jump but after I had got a handle on it, time management, coordinating work based on access to in-office 
							resources, remote communication and implementing long lasting software/hardware fixes all became acheivable. As well, my coordination of the office wide mobile phone 
							hardware upgrade left a lasting boost to the efficiency of day to day workflow leaving me satisfied with my contributions.</p>

					<section id="wt3-one">
						<h1>Work Term 3</h1>
						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>1.</h2>
								<h3>Reflect the goals and account for the strategies of the greater company when making company wide messages/posts</h3>
								<p>Seeing as how I received both regular feedback and positive comments on public posts made to the company-wide Teams board, 
									I see my goal as having been acheived. I also noticed that after developing my messages to be more concise and to the 
									point, more people were willing to take the time and read the post, such as in the case about my post regarding the 
									Spiceworks connection issues faced by a number of users.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>2.</h2>
								<h3>Devise and succesfully apply outside-the-box solutions to user's hardware and software issues</h3>
								<p>While I did not meet my problem-to-resolution timeframe of 15 minutes for all the software/hardware issues I tackled, I was 
									able to resolve the issue within that timeframe for the vast majority of standard problems. For example there was one instance
									in which I had just completed a rollout on a user's device and it was 15 minutes from the end of their shift when they began facing 
									licencing issues with their Adobe software. They only came in the office once a week so thankfully I was able to resolve the issue 
									before they left the office and still had time to wrap up my remaining tasks or the day.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>3.</h2>
								<h3>Gain an appreciation of the challenges with working with co-workers seperated by different timezones</h3>
								<p>Thankfully, I was able to meet this objective by the end of my work term as I only ever had to ask my senior co-worker a question once, when 
									he was not on the clock or in our timezone (relating to the newly developed Autopilot Rollout process). This was a key thing to grasp near
									the beginning of my term as my co-worker Kunal was working out of New Delhi at the time, but I kept a spare clock on my desktop display with
									his timezone to ensure I wouldn't message him at odd times.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>4.</h2>
								<h3>Maintain the self-discipline required to adhear to the quarantine restrictions as an essential in-office worker</h3>
								<p>I was able to acheive this goal as, for the entirety of the term, there were no cases that originating from the office even while different employee's 
									regularly visited from various locations for a variety of tasks. For instance there was one day were I had to both received a recently departed 
									employee's equipment, and oversee the repairs of a Dell laptop perfromed by a Dell Technician, and I ensured that both parties followed the in office
									policies to their full extent.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>5.</h2>
								<h3>Suggest a new product or process to be adopted by the Infotmarion Technology team</h3>
								<p>I acheived this goal as a result of one particular occasion where I was charged with creating a new internal storage expansion process that I 
									personally utilized for upgrading ~10 devices over the course of the term. This responsibility included both designing and writing the documentation 
									for the upgrades, determining the hardware and software to be used and conducting the process on my end.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<p>With the new toolkit I have developed from this work term, (configuring the hypervisor and RAID cards of Dell servers, and overseeing the remote Autopilot Rollout process of new laptops),
							I have developed credentials that are highly applicable in the both the information technology field and in the new remote work environment as a whole.</p>

							of new responsibilities like rolling out laptops for new employees using the Microsoft Intune Autopilot Rollout method and setting up Dell servers with Hypervisor software
							for client projects. New responsibilities like these aided me in developing new skills working with tools like Microsoft Powershell, and vSphere ESXi 6.5. The majority

						<p>At the end of my third work term at Eramosa, I was satisfied in the goals I had met, and glad that I had a further expanded toolkit of skills with which I had no prior experience.
							Configuring both the Hypervisor and RAID cards on new servers was an area in which I had no prior experience but I'm glad I had the opportunity to gain a level of awareness with 
							those key aspects of server preparation. Just like my second work term, the remote work environment presented challenges but after I climatized to it, I was able to fufill my

						<h1>Work Term 4</h1>
						<h2>Goals</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>1.</h2>
								<h3>Gain proficiency in navigating and utilizing the new software used for this position</h3>
								<p>I can now easily navigate Connectwise Manage and Control, as well as ITS247 and ITGlue, requiring very little time for me to gain 
									access to the functions, documents, and tickets that are needed for my daily work, indicating that my goal has been met in this instance. 
									This allowed me to put more time towards more productive activities such as resolving the PrintNightmare exploit which required us to manually 
									connect to every single workstation we managed and make a series of software configurations. This required me to use ITS247 and Connectwise Control
									extensively and because of my familiarity I had no issues performing several of these configurations in a short time frame.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>2.</h2>
								<h3>Make sure my daily tasks are recorded in some way to enhance the quality and comprehensiveness of my weekly timesheets.</h3>
								<p>I acheived this goal using a combination of my suggested action plan items, such as checking the time records on teams, and slack messages
									as well as the time records on my own phone for the start time of tasks and also the length of calls. As a result of this, most of my billed 
									time is accurate to the minute and makes account for the full breadth of tasks related to a given ticket.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>3.</h2>
								<h3>Deliver well written and comprehensive instructions and questions when adding a note on a ticket on ConnectWise Manage.</h3>
								<p>The vast majority of my ticket notes were constructed in a fashion that kept in mind the level of understanding of the reader (which I modified based on 
									whether the ticket note was public or internal). Accordingly, when a client or myself ever did need to check one of my tickets for information, there would 
									be an understanding of the work that had been done and what was left to do, meeting the goal to my satisfaction.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>4.</h2>
								<h3>Suggest and implement at least 3 new methods of resolving software issues for daily activities.</h3>
								<p>While I was not able meet the quantity of documents I had hoped to complete by the end of my term, I am content with the quality and depth of the two documents that 
									I was able to create. I developed said documents to be used when setting up Duo 2FA autentication with the Barracuda VPN login service and the Salesforce login 
									service for the Assaulted Womans Helpline, to help them to qualify for data insurance and enhance the protection of crucial private information.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>5.</h2>
								<h3>Sense when users may be either not mentioning or forgetting to describe key details when troubleshooting issues, and obtain those details in a tactful fashion.</h3>
								<p>I don't recall an instance in which I had to clarify the surrounding context of an issue following my initial check-in with the user. Actually resolving the problem 
									took up most of my follow up time for addressing their various issues and given this I think I've met the goal as I layed it out.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<p>Equipped with my new proficiencies from this work term, such as constructing a company wide 2FA integration for Barracuda VPNs and a Salesforce management site, and remotely accessing and

						<p>My day-to-day work items involved many responsibilities that I've come to expect from a IT techician role, such as preparing workstations, solving hardware and software obstacles,
							but this term was distinct from all my previous ones as it was the only time where I was completely seperated from the physical side of troubleshooting. It was nessecary for the 
							entirety of my work to be conducted from home, as there was no company office and no in-person access to the clients devices. Adapting to this new reality helped me to develop 
							new ways on approaching a given issue when I knew that I couldn't just have the user bring their device into the office for me to fix up. It also taught me to get involved with the soft
							side of the position, developing work documents for procedures on how to integrate Two Factor Authentication and made me aware of the difficulties associated with time-keeping 
							for multiple clients,(as I had only ever put my time towards one company whenever I filled out a timesheet in past work terms), both of which were skills I had never had academic experience with.</p>

						<p>By the end of my work term at A&S, I was happy having met the majority of the goals I had set out to achieve, and tempered from my time at a much smaller firm where it was necessary to make 
							myself more responsible for the work I did. The Connectwise application suite was a foreign set of software when I started but I'm glad that over the course of the term
							I was able to become proficient in it's use as it is a key management in many companies in this field. Distinct from all my prior work terms in it's difficulties, this term nevertheless
							taught me a great deal of important lessons about how to work in a proactive IT technician role instead of a reactive one.</p>
