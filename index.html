							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>1.</h2>
								<h3>Seek information pertaining to given problems and identify the causes, both independently & timely</h3>
								<p>By the end of the term I was able to quickly identify and fix issues, partly due to dealing with the similar 
									issues earier in the term, such as troubleshooting a office wide adobe acrobat crashing issue.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>2.</h2>
								<h3>Independentally devise and research fixes to software and hardware issues</h3>
								<p>It came to the point where I was able to fix multiple issues within an hour or 
									two without needing to consult my supervisor. For example I fixed two employee's 
									problems involving a version of Microsoft Teams than became hung on startup.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>3.</h2>
								<h3>Understand the numerous processes and solutions that assist in performing my day-to-day activities</h3>
								<p>An example that reflects how I came to reach this goal, was when I was tasked with mentoring another employee with the technical process involved in cloning and creating 
									a split disk format of a VM. Thanks to my understanding of the process, I was able to succesfully teach another employee a technical skill important 
									to a project.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>4.</h2>
								<h3>Adhear to the stated due dates on office tasks, and complete tasks without set dates in order of importance</h3>
								<p>Tasks were generally completed prior or on their due dates but the realities of the postition resulted in certain 
									lower priority tasks being delayed to focus on higher priority tasks. As an example, the rollout of regular employee's 
									new devices had to be suspended due to an unforseen hardware issue with a desktop used by upper management.</p>
							</article>
							<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
								<h2>5.</h2>
								<h3>Convey my points in a clear and concise manner, for a diverse range of readers</h3>
								<p>Two sentences was eventually the amount I was able to hone the large majority of my explanations 
									to and this was the same between both technical and non-technical employees. This helped me to move
									quickly through troubleshooting problems without much holdup on communication issues.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<p>The skills I learned in my journey towards these goals will certainly be an asset in any future IT positions I apply for because of the fact that
							the technical skills I learned are applicable across a wide variety of industries (Hardware rollout, Office 365 suite, etc.), and the majority 
							of my troubleshooting was done on Windows based devices, one of the most wided used OS's in the business world.</p>

						<p>From my time at Eramosa, I had acheived my stated goals, and learned a number of key skills that I had not excpected at the beginning of the term.

							VMware Workstation, G4L, and Disk2VHD, my set of skills has increased markedly since the beginning of my work term. Finally my contributions to the office wide
